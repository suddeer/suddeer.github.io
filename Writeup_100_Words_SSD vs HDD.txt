In my technical article titled 'SSD vs HDD - Picking the Ideal Drive for You,' I have included images of both SSD and HDD. These images enrich the article visually, making it more appealing to readers. Users can easily grasp the physical differences and specifications between these storage technologies. A comparative table also simplifies the differences between the two. Additionally, a flowchart has been used to help users choose between HDDs and SSDs for gaming applications. Overall, these visuals not only complement the content but also make the article more accessible and practical for the audience.
